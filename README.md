## General
This part illustrates the design of the power associated with the project. There are two KiCAD project folders. One of them is "403_charger_v1," and another one is "403_charger_v2". "403_charger_v1" is the initial design of the power, but it has some problems with the design. "403_charger_v2" is the design that problems got corrected. In the description of the documents, "403_charger_v2" will be described.

----
## Description
In the KiCAD project folder, there are three main files, which are "403_charger_v2.kicad_pcb", "403_charger_v2.kicad_pro", "403_charger_v2.kicad_sch". "403_charger_v2.kicad_pcb" is the PCB file of the power. "403_charger_v2.kicad_pro" is the project file of the power. "403_charger_v2.kicad_sch" is the schematic file of the power. These three files can only be opened by the KiCAD.

The circuit consists of 3 main circuits: the charging circuit, the protection circuit, and the boost circuit. Details of all components in the schematic will be shown below.

Three different track widths are used in the PCB design. They are 0.250mm, 0.500mm, and 0.750mm. The track of 0.250mm is used to transfer the signals around the chips. The track of 0.500 mm is used to connect pins involved with the output of the battery. The track of 0.750mm is used to be paths involved with boosted output. Additionally, two copper pour planes of GND are on the front and the back.

There is also another interactive BOM in the files. The path is "403_charger_v2\bom\ibom.html". In the "ibom.html," you can click the component on the PCB then the corresponding information of the component will be highlighted at the side. The following figure is the preview of the interactive BOM.

<!-- ## Update History
### 09.13.22 Update
1. The folder, "403_charger_v1", has been uploaded.
2. The 1st version of design has been finished and its draft schematic has been uploaded.  
3. All chips were purchased on 09.05.22. Approximately they will arrive here on 09.19.22.  
4. Next step is going to test these chips and check if the schematic is approachable. If the schematic can work very well, the PCB board will be planned to finish.   
5. The better design is looked for as the alternative case during the waiting time for chips.   

### 09.30.22 Update
